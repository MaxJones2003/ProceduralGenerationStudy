1. Segment data into quads, pre-interpolation

2. Find biomes in each quad
	a. further segment by each biome
	b. generate unique terrain styles for each biome,
	c. smoothe height map data between biome chunks
3. Apply textures based off of biome data
4. Generate flora based off of biome data
5. Generate POI's based off of roads and rivers

extra. figure out how to generate water, will probably happen during step 2
